Hi, there! 👋 Thanks for checking out this repository of my personal portfolio website, A project I created to test, improve upon as well as showcase my frontend skill-set. Check it out [here!][website]

I went for plain HTML and CSS without any framework so as to maintain a fresh and an authentic look with both [Netlify][netlify] and [Github Pages][github pages] as hosts.

## 🛠 Tools I Used
* [HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/). *(duh!)* 🤷‍♂️
* [jQuery][jquery] - A tiny bit. 🤏
* [VS Code][vs code] - My one and only. 🖤
* [Netlify][netlify] - Primary host. 🤝
* [Github Pages][github pages] - Just because! 🙌
* [Font Awesome][font awesome] - For icons. 📱

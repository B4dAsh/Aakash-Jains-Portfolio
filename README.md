# Aakash Jain's Portfolio.

Hi! This is repository of my portfolio website. I coded it in spare time to test and improve upon my front-end skillset.

* Find the website [here](https://aakashjain.ml).
* Coded predominantly in plain HTML and CSS without any frameworks, although not without a little Javascript here and there.
* Deployed from this repo and Hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
* If you find any bugs or have some constructive criticism don't hesitate to reach out by [mail](mailto:aakashjainofficial@gmail.com) or by using links at the footer of the website.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š

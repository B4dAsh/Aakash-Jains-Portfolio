Hi, there! 👋 Thanks for checking out this repository of my personal portfolio website, A project I created to test, improve upon as well as showcase my frontend skill-set. Check it out [here](https://aakashjain.ml/)!

I went for plain HTML and CSS without any framework so as to maintain a fresh and an authentic look with both [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as hosts.

## 🛠 Tools I Used
* [HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/). *(duh!)* 🤷‍♂️
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - A tiny bit. 🤏
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My one and only. 🖤
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Primary host. 🤝
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Just because! 🙌
